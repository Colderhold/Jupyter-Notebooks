**Jupyter Notebooks - Data Science and Machine Learning Projects**

This repository contains a collection of Jupyter notebooks showcasing my work in various domains of data science and machine learning. 

Each notebook explores different topics, techniques, and algorithms related to data analysis, machine learning, deep learning, and data visualization. 

The notebooks are accompanied by datasets and code examples to provide practical implementations and insights.

**Usage**

Feel free to explore the individual notebooks for detailed explanations, code examples, and results. 

Each notebook is provided with a dataset (if required) and the necessary code cells. 

You can open the notebooks in Jupyter or JupyterLab to interact with the code and run the cells.
